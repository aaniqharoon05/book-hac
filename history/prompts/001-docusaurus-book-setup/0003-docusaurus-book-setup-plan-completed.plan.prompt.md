## Prompt

you successfully setup the plan in 'c:/agentic ai A/book_h/specs/001-docusaurus-book-setup'

## Response snapshot

I have successfully set up the implementation plan for Docusaurus Book Setup in `c:/agentic ai A/book_h/specs/001-docusaurus-book-setup/plan.md`. Research has been conducted to clarify Node.js versions and testing frameworks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Plan document created and populated.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: `plan.md` created/modified, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, `contracts/` outlined for future creation.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin Phase 0 research, then Phase 1 design.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully filled `plan.md` and clarified technical context based on Context7 research.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial concurrent `Edit` tool calls failed, resolved by re-reading and sequential `Write` (overwriting the whole file).
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
